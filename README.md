A woodland generator for Root: The Roleplaying Game made in unity.

In Root: The Roleplaying Game the world is a woodland inhabited by animals. Many factions in the woodland are at war with each other though each player plays as a vagabond not tied to any faction in particular. The woodland is split into 12 clearings with paths between them and each clearing has a name; a dominant community of either foxes, mice or rabbits and each clearing may be under the control of or have precense of any of the major factions.

This project aims to automate and streamline the creation of the woodland as described in section 9: The Woodland at War in the core book and section 7: The War Advances in the Travellers & Outsiders supplement book.

The project is availble to download on itch.io at https://joehadf.itch.io/root-woodland-generator
