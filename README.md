A woodland generator for Root: The Roleplaying Game made in unity.

In Root: The Roleplaying Game the world is a woodland inhabited by animals. Many factions in the woodland are at war with each other though each player plays as a vagabond not tied to any faction in particular. The woodland is split into 12 clearings with paths between them and each clearing has a name; a dominant community of either foxes, mice or rabbits and each clearing may be under the control of or have precense of any of the major factions.

This project aims to automate and streamline the creation of the woodland as described in section 9: The Woodland at War in the core book and section 7: The War Advances in the Travellers & Outsiders supplement book.

Currently it generates 12 clearings in random locations and randomly chooses paths between them. The clearings are named and a major denizen is chosen from fox, mouse and rabbit. The clearings are able to be moved around by clicking and dragging them and a new layout can be generated by pressing R.

Planned Features:
- Randomly determining faction control in each clearing (DONE).
- Editing names and denizens and control of each clearing.
- Adding and Deleting clearings and paths to existing woodlands (DONE)
- Options to reroll each element (clearing locations, paths, denizens, names, faction control) seperately.
- The river going between non-adjacent clearings that is both able to be randomly generated and editable.
- Saving and loading clearing layouts.
- Choosing which factions you want to be involved in faction control setup.
